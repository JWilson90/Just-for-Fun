<h1>Home</h1>
<p>Welcome to The Hungry Archaeologist, where we strive to give the public a glimpse of different cultures, through a journey to the past.  Many traditional cooking methods and styles have been abandoned due to modernization, though there are man things we can learned from them.  If you wish to reconnect with your culinary heritage, you’ve come to the right place.  There has been much speculation about the food that we consume, and traditional recipes could be just the answer we are looking for.  With the recipes and information given through The Hungry Archaeologist, there should be no fear of GMO’s or preservatives, as all recipes come from a whole food basis.

Archaeologists can be a useful tool in the preservation and revitalization of traditional cooking methods.  Through pure curiosity, and a compulsion for a hands on approach, you can discover a new healthy way of eating.  Additionally, you will be taking part in a movement to preserve and rediscover foods that have been eaten for hundreds of years, that our modern society has forgotten.

So come along for the ride, as we discover a new (but old way) of cooking dinner!</p>
